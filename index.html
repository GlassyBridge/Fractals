    <h1>Exploring Fractals</h1>
    <p>
      Fractals are intricate and fascinating structures that exhibit self-similarity at various scales. 
      They are created by repeating simple mathematical processes. Fractals are not just beautiful; they 
      also appear in nature, art, and various scientific fields such as computer graphics, 
      physics, and biology. Their properties can model real-world phenomena, from the branching of trees 
      to the fractal patterns on leaves and coastlines.
